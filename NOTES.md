# NOTES



## Frontend

Possibly move to 2 pages?

- command mode
- stream waching mode





## Server

Set up a server model to listen for the incoming HTTP requests.







## Client

Set up a client poll the server for the latest set of commands or something like that

- poll HTTP endpoint
  - returns the last <= 10 commands given
- RPC
- use Redis as a queue



Use cliclick to route commands to the emulator.  https://github.com/BlueM/cliclick






TODO: confirm that the sound works
